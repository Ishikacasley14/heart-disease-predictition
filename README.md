# heart-disease-predictition
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease using logistic regression. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model based on patient health data to assist in early detection and risk assessment of heart-related ailments.
Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection crucial for effective intervention and treatment. This project focuses on employing logistic regression, a powerful statistical technique, to analyze a dataset consisting of various patient attributes and historical health records.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing techniques to clean, normalize, and handle missing data in the dataset.
Logistic Regression Model: Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
Visualization: Visual representation of key insights derived from the data and model predictions.
Deployment (Optional): Possibility to deploy the trained model as an API for real-time predictions.
